The national news media has different priorities compared to the local news media. If one seeks to build a collection about local events, the national news media may be insufficient, with the exception of local news which ''bubbles'' up to the national news media. Irrespective of this ''bubbling'' of some local news to the national surface, the perspective and reporting of national news differs from local news for the same events.

It is important to consult local sources affected by local events. Thus the need for a system that helps the user build a collection of web resources from local sources for local events.

The Local Memory Project provides tools to build collections ([#localmemory]) of stories for local events from local sources:
1. Local Memory Project - Chrome Extension
2. Local Memory Project - Geo
